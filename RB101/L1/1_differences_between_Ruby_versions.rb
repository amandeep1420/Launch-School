# start checking your specific Ruby version (2.6.3) @ ruby-doc.org under "Core API" when looking for info.
# be aware that things change from version to version - deprecations, cosolidations, additions, etc.
# Launch School tends to link to Ruby definitions for the ~most recent version~ - keep this in mind.
# in some situations, such as an assessment, you may occasionally be required to refer to a particular thing in line with a specific change to the Ruby API.
