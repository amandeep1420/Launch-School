# my answer:

5
8

# correct!! though we used the range documentation to make an educated guess vs. actually locating the documentation for .step itself w/in the Numeric 
# class docs, lol.

# key takeaway: when looking for methods that work with numbers, look at the docs for the following classes:

- Numeric
- Float
- Integer
- Math

# Float and Integer both pull from Numeric; Math is a module that supplies a lot of number crunching functionality.
