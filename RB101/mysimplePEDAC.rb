=begin

Attempting to rewrite the PEDAC template in an abbreviated form to assist with initial implementation.
Lot step make brain hurt; few simple step better in beginning.

Problem 
  - inputs + putputs
  - explicit requirements + implicit requirements
  - boil it down to a few sentences
  - (optional: contextual rules (the "domain"))
  - (optional: clarifying questions)
Examples
  - test cases (use requirements as basis)
  - edge cases (range ends, negatives, zero, high numbers, etc.)
Data structure
  - how will data be represented? (array, hash, strings, integers, etc.)
Algorithm
  - simple steps that can be translated to code 
  - don't use specific code
  - write sub-steps as necessary
      - again, keep them simple
Code
  - refer to algorithm as needed
  - test your edge cases
