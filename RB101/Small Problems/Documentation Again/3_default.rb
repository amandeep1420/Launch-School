# my answer:

# I can't seem to find the relevant documentation.
# guessing it'll be 4, 5, 6, nil

# wrong - first, all arguments without default values are filled positionally; once these arguments are filled, the method fills in default arguments 
# from left to right using remaining values until none are left.

# this exercises was more about documentation location - don't worry if you don't quite grasp the method itself.
