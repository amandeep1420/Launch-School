# Ruby doesn't require parentheses when invoking a method - hence why we can write puts or gets.chomp instead of puts() and gets().chomp().
# The book will be using them to keep things clear/avoid mixup with local variables, etc. for the time being while we get adjusted.
# The book will also be calling methods with their respective modules during this lesson, too - so puts will become Kernel.puts().
# This is purely for instructional purposes; we won't do this.
