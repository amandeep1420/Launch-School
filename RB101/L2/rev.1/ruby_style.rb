Quick style notes:

- tab size: 2 spaces
- # = comments (lol)




- naming files, initializing methods, initializing variables: snake_case.

this_is_a_snake_case_file.rb

empty_variable = 0

def this_is_a_method





- unchanging variables are referred to as constant variables, or 'constants' - use ALL CAPS.

CONSTANT = 'fish'
FIVE = 12









- do...end blocks for multiple lines; curly braces for one line.










- CamelCase when declaring classes.


class MyFirstClass
end

class MySecondBass
end
